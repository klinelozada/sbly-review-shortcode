[rp_excerpt]A decent pillow - however, the issue is that if their one size & firmness level doesn't work for you, you're kind of stuck. The Dosaze Pillow offers free exchanges to different sizes and firmness levels so you can find the best fit for you, so I would test that one instead.[/rp_excerpt]
